            </div>
            <p>Our platform allows you to create forms with various types of questions, from simple text ones to more complex multiple-choice or voting questions. You can choose the form colors, set the font style, and decide whether your form should be anonymous, private, or public.</p>

            <h3>Question Customization</h3>
            <p>When creating a form, you can customize each question according to your needs. Specify whether the question is mandatory or optional, and set the minimum and maximum number of possible answers for selected question types. This allows you to gather precise and relevant responses from respondents.</p>

            <h3>Voting and Results</h3>
            <p>Our platform also supports voting in the style of "for" or "against," which is great for a quick and clear expression of opinion. Voting results are then presented on the administrator's side in the form of beautiful and clear graphs. You can track the development and preferences using various types of graphs, making data analysis and interpretation easy.</p>
